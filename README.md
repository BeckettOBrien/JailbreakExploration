# Jailbreak Exploration

I really want to learn more about how jailbreaks work, but I can't find a lot of great detailed information online apart from source code, which is difficult to read through when its this complex of a project. I don't really know much about iOS and XNU internals, but after trying to read things on specific topics, I'm going to try a more hands-on approach to learn how stuff works. Ideally, with enough work, I can figure everything out and have a working jailbreak for iOS 14. I'll continue using the source code for public jailbreaks as reference, but intsead of replicating everything that they do, I want to just have the end goal of a useable jailbreak and I'll figure out the steps to get there by myself. As long as it works, it doesn't matter if it's done differently. I also want to document my progress and create a fairly detailled writeup for others who are looking for the same information that I have been looking for.
